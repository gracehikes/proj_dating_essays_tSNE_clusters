# Abstract
Natural Language Processing models are the keystone to enabling computers to learn human languages and respond similarly. We use this more and more in our daily activities, for example asking Google or Siri for a stock market update, weather report, top news stories.

The first steps involve machine learning on text data, after which the text gets transformed into high-dimensional numerical vectors or embeddings. At present, the number of resulting dimensions can range from hundreds to thousands. After the text data gets converted into numbers and vector space, we can pass it on down the machine learning pipeline.


# Methodology
While it is easy to understand and visualize two or three dimensions, it becomes impossible with the high-dimensional space of text embeddings. Google and Facebook have a couple of the current state-of-the-art language embedding algorithms out there. Google’s Universal Sentence Encoder which produces 512 embedding dimensions while Facebook’s Infersent churns out a whopping 4,096 dimensions!

One of the ways of trying to visualize high-dimensional data is a tool called t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). With t-SNE, we can look at the embeddings in two or three dimensional space. This is useful for checking if clusters existed in the data.

My analysis scope:
* apply Google's Universal Sentence Encoder and get 512 embedding dimensions for each essay
* apply t-SNE algorithm and reduce high-dimensional embeddings from 512 down to 2
* limit essay lengths to first 30 / 70 / 140 characters and look for clusters in 2-dimensional space 
* explore presence of clusters along features like dating app user's age, gender and pet preference

# Results
It appeared men and women write in very similar manner for their dating self-summaries - see visualizations below. There were no clear clusters to be visualized by age of the dating singles. For pet preference, I also did not see separate clusters for dog-lovers versus cat-lovers. 

The longer the essay snippets used to generate embeddings, the closer the visualized data points start to merge to one another as shown in the diagrams below. The ability to see clusters (if any) favored shorter essay lengths.
